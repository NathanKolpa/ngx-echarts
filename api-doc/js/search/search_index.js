Angular >= 6\nv2.3.1 for Angular https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts/blob/v2.x/README.md)\n\nA starter project on Github: https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts-starter\nLatest Update\n\n2021.01.10: v6.0.0:\n\nPR #285: Guard dispose (bygjsmith66)\nupdate demo to use echarts v5.0\n\n\n2020.12.14: v6.0.0-alpha.2, v5.2.2:\n\nPR #282: fix avoid \"ResizeObserver loop limit exceeded\" error (byparkdihoon)\n\n\n2020.11.07: v6.0.0-alpha.1:\n\nPR #272: Angular 10 support (byGhostbird)\n\n\n2020.11.07: v5.2.1:\n\nRequired resize-observer-polyfill\nPR #271: Fix autoResize functionality (byThomasBower)\nExposed methods: refreshChart() and resize()\n\n\n2020.08.06: v5.1.2:\n\nPR #254: Fix Angular 10 generic ModuleWithProviders depreciation (byolicooper)\n\n\n2020.08.06: v5.1.1:\n\nNPM package is broken.\n\n\n2020.07.24: v5.1.0:\n\nPR #240: Added output 'optionsError' (by trajnisz)\nPR #242: Add output for brushEnd event (by Uular)\nPR #246: Allow loading echarts library lazily via native import (by smnbbrv)\n\n\n2020.05.19: v5.0.0\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\nNgxEchartsModule provides .forRoot() method to inject echarts core.\nDue to .forRoot method, we can do custom build without NgxEchartsCoreModule. Just import the echarts core from echarts/src/echarts, and other necessary charts.\nNgxEchartsCoreModule is removed.\n[detectEventChanges] is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\nSince v5.0\n# if you use npm\nnpm install echarts -S\nnpm install ngx-echarts -S\nnpm install resize-observer-polyfill -D\n\n# or if you use yarn\nyarn add echarts\nyarn add ngx-echarts\nyarn add -D resize-observer-polyfill\nIf you need ECharts GL support, please install it first:\nnpm install echarts-gl -S\n\n# or\nyarn add echarts-gl\nImport other extensions such as themes or echarts-gl in your main.ts: ECharts Extensions\n\n\nUpgrade from v4.x\n\nimport echarts and provide it in NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({ echarts }).\nNgxEchartsCoreModule is removed.\n\nUsage\nPlease refer to the demo page.\n\nFirstly, import NgxEchartsModule in your app module (or any other proper angular module):\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({\n      /**\n       * This will import all modules from echarts.\n       * If you only need custom modules,\n       * please refer to [Custom Build] section.\n       */\n      echarts: () => import('echarts'), // or import('./path-to-my-custom-echarts')\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}The echarts library will be imported only when it gets called the first time thanks to the function that uses the native import.\nYou can also directly pass the echarts instead which will slow down initial rendering because it will load the whole echarts into your main bundle.\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({\n      echarts,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\nThen: use echarts directive in a div which has pre-defined height. (From v2.0, it has default height: 400px)\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\nscss:\n\n.demo-chart {\n  height: 400px;\n}\ncomponent:\n\nimport { EChartOption } from 'echarts';\n\n// ...\n\nchartOption: EChartOption = {\n  xAxis: {\n    type: 'category',\n    data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'],\n  },\n  yAxis: {\n    type: 'value',\n  },\n  series: [\n    {\n      data: [820, 932, 901, 934, 1290, 1330, 1320],\n      type: 'line',\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\n\n\nAPI\nDirective\necharts directive support following input properties:\n\n\n\nInput\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n[options]\nobject\nnull\nThe same as the options on the official demo site.\n\n\n[merge]\nobject\nnull\nUsed to update a part of the options, especially helpful when you need to update the chart data. In fact, the value of merge will be used in echartsInstance.setOption() with notMerge = false. Refer to ECharts documentation for details.\n\n\n[loading]\nboolean\nfalse\nUsed to toggle the echarts loading animation when your data is not ready.\n\n\n[autoResize]\nboolean\ntrue\nIf set to true, the chart will be automatically resized when the window's width is changed.\n\n\n[initOpts]\nobject\nnull\nThe value of [initOpts] will be used in echarts.init(). It may contain devicePixelRatio, renderer, width or height properties. Refer to ECharts documentation for details.\n\n\n[theme]\nstring\nnull\nUsed it to initialize echarts with theme. The theme file must also be imported in main.ts.\n\n\n[loadingOpts]\nobject\nnull\nInput an object to customize the loading style. Refer to ECharts documentation for details.\n\n\n\nBy default, loadingOpts is:\n{\n  text: 'loading',\n  color: '#c23531',\n  textColor: '#000',\n  maskColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)',\n  zlevel: 0\n}ECharts API\nIf you need to access parts of the ECharts API such as echarts.graphic, please import it from echarts. For example:\nimport { graphic } from 'echarts';\n\nnew graphic.LinearGradient(/* ... */);ECharts Instance\nechartsInstance is exposed (since v1.1.6) in the (chartInit) event, enabling you to directly call functions like: resize(), showLoading(), etc. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\ncomponent:\n\nonChartInit(ec) {\n  this.echartsInstance = ec;\n}\n\nresizeChart() {\n  if (this.echartsInstance) {\n    this.echartsInstance.resize();\n  }\n}ECharts Extensions\nImport echarts theme files or other extension files after you have imported echarts core. For example:\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts';\n\n/** echarts extensions: */\nimport 'echarts-gl';\nimport 'echarts/theme/macarons.js';\nimport 'echarts/dist/extension/bmap.min.js';Service\nNgxEchartsService has been obsolete since v4.0\nEvents\nAs ECharts supports the 'click', 'dblclick', 'mousedown', 'mouseup', 'mouseover', 'mouseout', and 'globalout' mouse events, our ngx-echarts directive also supports the same mouse events but with an additional chart prefix. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\nThe '$event' is same with the 'params' that ECharts dispatches.\n\nIt supports following event outputs:\n\n\n\n@Output\nEvent\n\n\n\n\nchartInit\nEmitted when the chart is initialized\n\n\nchartClick\necharts event: 'click'\n\n\nchartDblClick\necharts event: 'dblclick'\n\n\nchartMouseDown\necharts event: 'mousedown'\n\n\nchartMouseMove\necharts event: 'mousemove'\n\n\nchartMouseUp\necharts event: 'mouseup'\n\n\nchartMouseOver\necharts event: 'mouseover'\n\n\nchartMouseOut\necharts event: 'mouseout'\n\n\nchartGlobalOut\necharts event: 'globalout'\n\n\nchartContextMenu\necharts event: 'contextmenu'\n\n\nchartLegendSelectChanged\necharts event: 'legendselectchanged'\n\n\nchartLegendSelected\necharts event: 'legendselected'\n\n\nchartLegendUnselected\necharts event: 'legendunselected'\n\n\nchartLegendScroll\necharts event: 'legendscroll'\n\n\nchartDataZoom\necharts event: 'datazoom'\n\n\nchartDataRangeSelected\necharts event: 'datarangeselected'\n\n\nchartTimelineChanged\necharts event: 'timelinechanged'\n\n\nchartTimelinePlayChanged\necharts event: 'timelineplaychanged'\n\n\nchartRestore\necharts event: 'restore'\n\n\nchartDataViewChanged\necharts event: 'dataviewchanged'\n\n\nchartMagicTypeChanged\necharts event: 'magictypechanged'\n\n\nchartPieSelectChanged\necharts event: 'pieselectchanged'\n\n\nchartPieSelected\necharts event: 'pieselected'\n\n\nchartPieUnselected\necharts event: 'pieunselected'\n\n\nchartMapSelectChanged\necharts event: 'mapselectchanged'\n\n\nchartMapSelected\necharts event: 'mapselected'\n\n\nchartMapUnselected\necharts event: 'mapunselected'\n\n\nchartAxisAreaSelected\necharts event: 'axisareaselected'\n\n\nchartFocusNodeAdjacency\necharts event: 'focusnodeadjacency'\n\n\nchartUnfocusNodeAdjacency\necharts event: 'unfocusnodeadjacency'\n\n\nchartBrush\necharts event: 'brush'\n\n\nchartBrushEnd\necharts event: 'brushend'\n\n\nchartBrushSelected\necharts event: 'brushselected'\n\n\nchartRendered\necharts event: 'rendered'\n\n\nchartFinished\necharts event: 'finished'\n\n\n\nYou can refer to the ECharts tutorial: Events and Actions in ECharts for more details of the event params. You can also refer to the demo page for a detailed example.\nCustom Build\nLegacy Custom Build\n\nPlease refer to ECharts Documentation for more details.\n\nIf you want to produce a custom build of ECharts, prepare a file like custom-echarts.ts:\n// custom-echarts.ts\nexport * from 'echarts/src/echarts';\n\nimport 'echarts/src/chart/line';\nimport 'echarts/src/chart/bar';\n// component examples:\nimport 'echarts/src/component/tooltip';\nimport 'echarts/src/component/title';\nimport 'echarts/src/component/toolbox';And then inject it in your NgxEchartsModule:\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\nimport * as echarts from './custom-echarts';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({\n      echarts,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}And if you want to use the global echarts object, please import it from lib or src instead:\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts/lib/echarts';If you need to import theme files, remember to change the 'echarts' path to 'echarts/lib/echarts', for example:\n// ... part of echarts/theme/dark.js:\nfunction (root, factory) {\n    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n        // AMD. Register as an anonymous module.\n        define(['exports', 'echarts/lib/echarts'], factory);\n    } else if (typeof exports === 'object' && typeof exports.nodeName !== 'string') {\n        // CommonJS\n        factory(exports, require('echarts/lib/echarts'));\n    } else {\n        // Browser globals\n        factory({}, root.echarts);\n    }\n}Treeshaking Custom Build\n\nSince version 5.0.1 ECharts supports Treeshaking with NPM.\n\nThere is no need for the custom-echarts.ts file anymore. The app.modules.ts should look like this:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\n\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import the echarts core module, which provides the necessary interfaces for using echarts.\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts/core';\n// Import bar charts, all with Chart suffix\nimport {\n    BarChart\n} from 'echarts/charts';\nimport {\n  TitleComponent,\n  TooltipComponent,\n  GridComponent\n} from 'echarts/components';\n// Import the Canvas renderer, note that introducing the CanvasRenderer or SVGRenderer is a required step\nimport {\n  CanvasRenderer\n} from 'echarts/renderers';\nimport 'echarts/theme/macarons.js';\n\necharts.use(\n  [TitleComponent, TooltipComponent, GridComponent, BarChart, CanvasRenderer]\n);\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({ echarts }),\n    HttpClientModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Demo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening on: http://localhost:4202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
